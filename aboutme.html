        <p2> <..>Sheila Levrant de Bretteville 'Taste and Style Just Aren’t Enough' it says that 'if the designer is to make a deliberate contribution of society, he must be able to integrate all he can learn about behaviour and resourses, ecology and human needs; taste and style just aren't enough' this way  I want to reiterate my thoughts that the designer must be comprehensively developed and have the ability to analyze the modern world. <..></p2>
