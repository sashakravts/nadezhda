                    <br>It was very important for me to
            transform all the information that I received during
            the interview into something very important.
            That was the challenge for me because I couldn’t
            distribute my time enough to get a good design with
            high-quality content inside.
            Initially, my idea was to create a special guide for
            people with an unstable psyche, but later I realized
            that Nastya’s blog is already such a guide. And then I
            decided to focus on herself and talk about her inner
            feelings and attitude to work, because we never know
            what is happening inside the psychologist.
            Turning to design, I want to say that it is directly
            based on the recording of my interview. Each time,
            Nastya answered me brie y enough at the very beginning,
            and then she said a lot of everything else, and this is
            the basis for highlighting the most important words on
            which the whole answer to the question is based
            In conclusion, I want to say that I really regret that
            I could not create more options for design and layout.
            As for the project, I have mixed feelings because I was
            extremely interested </br> </p2>
